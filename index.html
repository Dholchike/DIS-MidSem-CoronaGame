          This game has been made in remembrance of the horrors of <br>coronavirus that 2020 brought along with it. The coronavirus<br> wants to infect as many people as it can, meanwhile <br>vaccines as obstacles are placed, which the player has to avoid. <br>This game draws its inspiration from the Chrome-Dino/T-Rex Game.
